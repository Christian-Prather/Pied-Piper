I have created a very simplistic compression program specifically targeted at .txt papers and paragraphs.
The user provides the location of a .txt file they would like to compress, and the program parses through the file pulling out the top three most frequent words. These words are than replaced with single byte representation values (1,2,3), reducing the overall size of the .txt file and informing the user of how compressed the new file is relative to the original source. This compressed file is given the extension .pra. The program then generates a separate lookup table in the same folder as the compressed file, which is user defined. Once a user wants to decompress the file the program is ran again, this time the user selects decompress from the cmd line interface and the program replaces the single byte representations with the full word. I was unfortunately not able to build a gui for the program using sfml as I had hoped however,
I would like to try this with QT in the future. I also could further optimize the program by selection the longest words in addition to most frequent.
