 I have created a very simplistic compression program specifically targeted at .txt papers and
 paragraphs. The user provides 1 location of a .txt 2 they would like 3 compress, and 1 program parses through 1 2 pulling out 1 top three most frequent words. These words are than replaced with single byte representation values (1,2,3), reducing 1 overall size of 1 .txt 2 and informing 1 user of how compressed 1 new 2 is relative 3 1 original source. This compressed 2 is given 1 extension .pra. The program then generates a separate lookup table in 1 same folder as 1 compressed file, which is user defined. Once a user wants 3 decompress 1 2 1 program is ran again, this time 1 user selects decompress from 1 cmd line interface and 1 program replaces 1 single byte representations with 1 full word. I was unfortunately not able 3 build a gui for 1 program using sfml as I had hoped
 however, I would like 3 try this with QT in 1 future. I also could further optimize 1 program by selection 1 longest words in addition 3 most frequent.
